Description: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) works well when the input file
    is a clean, high-resolution image/document. But many documents exist in
    digital form only as (often old) low-resolution or "messy" PDFs/images. Pre-
    processing images can help improve OCR accuracy, but oftentimes those steps
    are of limited utility. Post-processing an OCR document can substantially
    improve accuracy, and this processing can be informed by determining the
    distribution of word frequencies in a corpus and by identifying common
    errors. This package contains a set of tools for getting the distributions
    of n-grams from a 'gold standard' set of input PDFs with a text layer;
    simulating low-quality image-based PDFs from the gold set; and identifying
    errors that arise from OCR of the low-quality, image-based PDFs.
